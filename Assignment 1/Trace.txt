Scenario 1: All Right-Handed Philosophers
Parameters: 5 0 1 1 0

Output:
Philosopher 0 thinks for 1 units
Philosopher 4 thinks for 1 units
Philosopher 2 thinks for 1 units
Philosopher 1 thinks for 1 units
Philosopher 3 thinks for 1 units
Philosopher 3 wants left chopstick
Philosopher 4 wants left chopstick
Philosopher 4 has left chopstick
Philosopher 0 wants left chopstick
Philosopher 2 wants left chopstick
Philosopher 1 wants left chopstick
Philosopher 1 has left chopstick
Philosopher 3 has left chopstick
Philosopher 0 has left chopstick
Philosopher 2 has left chopstick

Observations:
- All philosophers began by thinking for 1 unit of time, consistent with the provided thinking time parameter.
- Each philosopher then attempted to pick up their left chopstick. Given their right-handed preference, this behavior was expected as part of the setup prone to deadlock.
- The provided output does not conclusively show a deadlock situation, but given the sequence of actions, a deadlock is a potential outcome if no philosopher can acquire both chopsticks to eat.

Scenario 2: Mixed Handedness to Avoid Deadlock
Parameters: 5 philosophers, 10 cycles, 1000 ms max thinking and eating times, mixed handedness (1)

Observations:
- The simulation demonstrates that introducing mixed handedness among philosophers effectively prevents deadlock. Each philosopher is observed to complete their cycles of thinking and eating without the program becoming stuck.
- Philosophers are seen successfully alternating between acquiring left and right chopsticks, eating, and then releasing the chopsticks, indicative of an efficient resource sharing mechanism that the mixed handedness strategy facilitates.
- Notably, the output shows continuous activity with no philosopher indefinitely waiting for a chopstick, contrasting sharply with scenarios where all philosophers have the same handedness and are prone to deadlock.

Insights:
- The mixed handedness approach disrupts the potential for a circular wait condition by ensuring that at least one philosopher can break the chain of holding and waiting for chopsticks, thus significantly reducing the likelihood of deadlock.
- This scenario underscores the importance of carefully considering resource allocation strategies and their impact on system behavior in concurrent programming environments.

Scenario 3: Large Thinking and Eating Times

Parameters: 5 0 1 1 0

Output:
Philosopher 4 thinks for 333 units
Philosopher 4 wants left chopstick
Philosopher 4 has left chopstick
Philosopher 4 wants right chopstick
Philosopher 4 has right chopstick
Philosopher 3 thinks for 768 units
Philosopher 4 eats for 431 units
Philosopher 4 releases right chopstick
Philosopher 4 releases left chopstick
Philosopher 3 wants left chopstick
Philosopher 3 has left chopstick.........

Observations:
- This scenario involves philosophers with large thinking and eating times.
- Each philosopher goes through a thinking phase before attempting to eat.
- The output demonstrates the process of philosophers attempting to acquire chopsticks, eating, and then releasing the chopsticks.
- Despite the long thinking and eating times, the system manages the philosophers' interactions effectively, allowing them to take turns eating without deadlock.
